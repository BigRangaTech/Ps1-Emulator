# UI/UX Direction

## Goals
- Friendly, low-friction setup for BIOS and plugin paths.
- Clear feedback for status, errors, and performance.
- Safe defaults with easy toggles for speed vs accuracy.

## Near-Term (Text UI)
- Menu-driven actions (run cycles, dump dynarec profile).
- Clear headings and prompts.
- Consistent error messaging.

## Planned GUI
- Scene-based layout (Library, Settings, Live Session).
- One-click profile presets (Fast, Balanced, Accurate).
- Real-time counters (FPS, CPU cycles, cache hits).
- Per-plugin status with restart controls.

## Current GUI
- SDL2-based layout with sidebar navigation.
- Library, Settings, and Session views.
- Focus on clear typography and calm palette.
- BIOS import/browse workflow for local and Flatpak-safe setups.
